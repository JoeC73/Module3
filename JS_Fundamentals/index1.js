// The answer is 10 because an empty string is known as zero(false) so you will just add the other numbers.

console.log("" + 1 + 0)


// The answer is negative 1 because of the empty quotes is known as zero and a negateive 1 + 0 will result in a -1. 

console.log("" - 1 + 0)

//  The answer is 1 because true is the value 1 and false is the value zero so its like adding 1 + 0. 

console.log(true + false)

/*This is a negation where the ! hegates the value. (opposite)
The answer would be false. */


console.log(!true)

// The answer would be 2. The numbers are automatically converted from strings to numbers. 

console.log(6 / "3")
console.log("2" * "3")

// The answer is 9px. The first numbers are added and the string is concatenated with the number.

console.log(4 + 5 + "px")

// The answer is $45. The string concatenates the rest of the expression together. 

console.log("$" + 4 + 5)

// The answer is 2 since this converts string to numbers.

console.log("4" - 2)

// This answer is not a number (NaN)

console.log("4px" - 2)

// The answer is -9 5 with a space because the string was spaced when it was added to the number. It was concatenated also.

console.log(" -9 " + 5)


// The answer is -14 because of number conversion and only the + will concatenate strings and numbers.

console.log(" -9  " - 5)

// The answer is 1. Null converts to 0 so it will be 0 + 1 which is 1.

console.log(null + 1)

// This answer is not a number (NaN). Undefined results as unknown or non-existent. 

console.log(undefined + 1)

// The == shows the equivalence of between both values and shows that its true. 

console.log(undefined == null)

// The answer is false. The values are not equal but are equivalent to one another. 

console.log(undefined === null)

// The answer is -2 because the \n and the \t are for new line breaks and for tab breaks for new line. 

console.log(" \t \n" - 2)
